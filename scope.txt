Base setups:
    Reading all info:
        1. Manually typing and populating the arrays
        2. Store all data in an external txt or csv file
    Storing once read:
        What needs to be stored:
            1. Times
            2. Module name
            3. Lecture num / prac num
            array (of structs of module) [
                struct (module) {
                    std::string name;
                    int numLectGroups;
                    int numLecPerWeek;
                    int numPracs;
                    int numTuts;
                    bool lecCompulsory;
                    bool tutCompulsory;
                    struct(all of timeSlot structs) lectures;  // each struct = a group and will have to have arrays for each group in here
                    struct(all of timeSlot structs) pracs;
                    struct(all of timeSlot structs) tuts;
                }
                struct (module) {

                }
                struct (module) {
                    
                }
            ]
    Actually creating the timetable:
        Go over all options:
            Recursion
        Store:
            2d array
            timeTable {
                monday {}
                next day {}
                next day {}
                next day {}
                next day {}
            }
    Storing all:
        3d array of the 2d timetables as an array
